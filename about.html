            <p class="text-light">
                I am a Data Scientist with a solid foundation in software engineering and financial data analysis. Having recently completed my Master's in Data Science from the University of Essex, I am skilled in using Python and SQL to analyze and interpret large datasets, helping organizations make informed and data-driven decisions.

            <p class="text-light">
                My professional experience spans roles such as a Financial Data Analyst at Crowwd, where I contributed to the expansion of portfolio value through market trend analysis, and as a Data Analyst at Sainsburyâ€™s, where I cleaned, organized, and visualized data to support strategic decisions. I also gained hands-on experience as a Data Science Intern at Solar Secure IT Solutions, where I applied machine learning algorithms for price prediction and fraud detection.
